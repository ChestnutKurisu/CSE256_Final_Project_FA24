## OlympiadBench: A Challenging Benchmark for Promoting AGI with Olympiad-Level Bilingual Multimodal Scientific Problems - Extensive Summary

This paper introduces OlympiadBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in solving complex scientific problems.  The benchmark addresses the limitations of existing datasets, which have become too easy for state-of-the-art models and lack the multimodal aspects often present in real-world scientific problem-solving.

**1. Introduction:**

The paper highlights the impressive progress of LLMs and LMMs in various tasks, including text and code generation and mathematical reasoning. Models like GPT-4 and Gemini Ultra have surpassed human-level performance on several benchmarks. However, the authors argue that existing benchmarks in scientific reasoning, particularly in mathematics and physics, are insufficiently challenging for these advanced models.  They specifically mention datasets like GSM8K and MATH for mathematics, and SciQ, ScienceQA, and JEEBench for physics, noting that even sophisticated models achieve high accuracy on these. The lack of multimodal challenges is also identified as a significant shortcoming.

**2. Related Work:**

The paper reviews existing benchmarks for mathematical and physical reasoning, highlighting their limitations:

* **Mathematics Benchmarks:** Datasets like GSM8K focus on elementary-level arithmetic problems.  More challenging datasets like MATH exist but are being quickly surpassed by advanced LLMs.  Theorem proving benchmarks also exist, but they often require translating natural language proofs into formal representations, a labor-intensive process.
* **Physics Benchmarks:**  Benchmarks like SciQ and ScienceQA primarily consist of multiple-choice questions, lacking complex reasoning and computation. JEEBench offers multi-step reasoning but remains limited in scope.  SciEval and SciBench provide more challenging free-response questions, with SciBench including multimodal information.
* **Multimodal Benchmarks:**  Datasets like Geometry3K and GeoQA focus on geometric problems with diagrams.  MMMU and CMMMU are multimodal, multi-disciplinary benchmarks but lack the focus on Olympiad-level difficulty.  MathVista integrates multiple multimodal datasets but doesn't delve into the complexity of the problems.

The authors emphasize that OlympiadBench aims to overcome these limitations by providing a more rigorous and comprehensive benchmark.

**3. The OlympiadBench Dataset:**

OlympiadBench comprises 8,476 problems in mathematics and physics, sourced from:

* International and Chinese Olympiad competitions
* The Chinese College Entrance Exam (Gaokao)

**Design Principles:**

1. **Olympiad-Level Problems:**  Focus on open-ended, high-difficulty problems.
2. **Detailed Solutions:** Expert-level annotations are provided for each problem, detailing the reasoning steps.
3. **Incorporation of Visuals:**  Includes problems requiring multimodal reasoning (text and images).
4. **Minimization of Data Leakage:** Problems are sourced from official websites, minimizing the risk of data leakage into model training datasets.

**Data Processing:**

1. **Data Collection:**  PDFs are collected from official sources.
2. **Format Conversion & Deduplication:** Mathpix is used for OCR, and then conversion to markdown format.  Manual verification is performed, and deduplication is done using a language model trained on mathematical symbols.
3. **Classification Labeling:** Problems are annotated with topic, problem type (open-ended, theorem proving), and answer type (numeric, expression, equation, interval, tuple).  Table 3 gives examples of answer types.

**Data Characteristics:**

* **Progressive Problems in Physics:** Some problems are structured sequentially, with later parts depending on earlier solutions.
* **Answer Type Classification:** Answers are categorized into a limited set of types for easier automated scoring.

**Automatic Scoring Pipeline (Algorithm 1):**

The pipeline simplifies the evaluation process by categorizing answers into numerical and symbolic expressions.  It uses floating-point operations for numerical comparisons and SymPy for symbolic expression equivalence checks.  A tolerance for error is included, especially for physics problems.

**4. Experiments:**

**Settings:**

The experiments evaluate both open-source and closed-source LLMs and LMMs in a zero-shot setting. A consistent prompt template (Figure 3) is used across all models to minimize prompt engineering bias.  Theorem proving problems are manually evaluated, while open-ended problems use the automatic scoring pipeline.

**Baselines:**

* **LMMs:** GPT-4V, Gemini-Pro-Vision, Qwen-VL-Max (closed-source); Yi-VL-34B, LLaVA-NeXT-34B (open-source).  For text-only problems, the corresponding text-only models or base LLMs are used for comparison.
* **LLMs:** DeepSeeKMath-7B-RL is used as a baseline for text-only problems.

**Main Results (Table 4):**

* OlympiadBench proves significantly harder than existing benchmarks (Table 7).  The best-performing model, GPT-4V, achieves only 17.97% accuracy overall.
* A substantial performance gap exists between closed-source and open-source models.
* Multimodal questions are more challenging than text-only ones. Physics problems, especially those with images, are harder than mathematics problems.
* Open-source LLMs show rapid progress, with DeepSeeKMath-7B-RL performing well on text-only math problems.
* Multimodal training may slightly affect performance on text-only tasks, but can improve it in some cases (Table 8).

**5. Analysis:**

* **Theorem Proving:**  Manual evaluation of GPT-4V on theorem proving questions reveals significant challenges, including difficulty in utilizing image information and frequent logical errors.
* **Mistake Analysis:** Analysis of GPT-4V errors on open-ended questions (Figure 4) shows common issues like insufficient classification discussions in mathematics and conceptual confusion in physics.

**6. Discussion and Future Work:**

The paper discusses challenges in automating the evaluation of theorem proving problems and suggests future work on expanding the benchmark to include other scientific disciplines.

**7. Conclusion:**

OlympiadBench provides a challenging benchmark for assessing the scientific reasoning capabilities of large models. The detailed analysis of model performance offers valuable insights for future research in AGI.
