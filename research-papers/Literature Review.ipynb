    "This paper explores chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting as a method to improve the complex reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).  The core idea is to provide the LLM with examples that include not just the input and output, but also a step-by-step reasoning process (the \"chain of thought\") leading to the answer.  This contrasts with standard few-shot prompting, which only provides input-output pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The researchers evaluated the effectiveness of CoT prompting on three families of LLMs (GPT-3, LaMDA, PaLM) across various benchmarks encompassing arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning.  The benchmarks included:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Arithmetic Reasoning:** GSM8K (math word problems), SVAMP (math word problems with varying structures), ASDiv (diverse math word problems), AQuA (algebraic word problems), MAWPS (math word problems with varying difficulty).\n",
    "* **Commonsense Reasoning:** CSQA (commonsense questions), StrategyQA (multi-hop reasoning questions), Date Understanding (date inference), Sports Understanding (plausibility of sports-related sentences), SayCan (mapping natural language to robot actions).\n",
    "* **Symbolic Reasoning:** Last letter concatenation (concatenating last letters of words in a name), Coin flip (tracking coin state after multiple flips).\n",
    "\n",
    "For each benchmark, they compared the performance of standard few-shot prompting with CoT prompting.  The CoT prompts included a small number (typically 8) of `<input, chain of thought, output>` triples as examples.  They used greedy decoding for model generation, though they acknowledge later work showing that sampling multiple generations and taking the majority answer improves results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Major Algorithms and Formulas:**\n",
    "\n",
    "No novel algorithms were introduced. The core methodology relies on the existing capabilities of pre-trained LLMs, leveraging few-shot learning and in-context learning.  The only formula implicitly used is basic arithmetic in the context of solving math word problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `<input, chain of thought, output>`: Represents a single example in a CoT prompt.\n",
    "*  ∼:  Used to denote \"approximately\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concepts and Conceptualizations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Chain of Thought (CoT):** A series of intermediate natural language reasoning steps that lead to the final answer.\n",
    "* **Few-shot learning:** Training a model on a small number of examples.\n",
    "* **In-context learning:**  The ability of LLMs to adapt to new tasks based on a few examples provided in the input prompt.\n",
    "* **Prompting:**  Providing a specific input to an LLM to elicit a desired output.\n",
    "* **Emergent ability:** A capability that arises unexpectedly as a result of scaling model size, not predictably from the performance of smaller models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results and Outcomes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The key findings were:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Significant Performance Improvement:** CoT prompting substantially improved performance across all benchmarks, often exceeding state-of-the-art results achieved by fine-tuned models.  The improvements were particularly dramatic on more complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Emergence with Scale:**  The benefits of CoT prompting were only observed in sufficiently large LLMs (generally >100B parameters). Smaller models often produced fluent but illogical CoT sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Robustness:** The improvements were robust to variations in the CoT examples, including those written by different annotators and those sampled from existing datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Length Generalization (Symbolic Reasoning):** CoT prompting facilitated generalization to longer sequences in symbolic reasoning tasks, outperforming standard prompting on out-of-domain examples (longer sequences than those seen during prompting).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Ablation Studies:**  Ablation studies showed that the success of CoT prompting wasn't solely due to increased computational cost or simply providing intermediate equations; the natural language reasoning steps in the CoT were crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper includes several tables detailing the quantitative results across different models, benchmarks, and prompting methods.  These tables show the accuracy of standard prompting versus CoT prompting, demonstrating the consistent improvement offered by the CoT approach.  The tables also present ablation studies and robustness analysis, showing the impact of different variations of the prompting method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discussion and Reasoning:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors discuss the emergence of CoT reasoning as a function of model scale, suggesting that it's a complex phenomenon involving various factors like semantic understanding, symbol manipulation, and logical reasoning. They highlight that CoT prompting expands the capabilities of LLMs beyond what's achievable with standard prompting alone.  They also acknowledge limitations, such as the cost associated with creating CoT examples and the lack of guarantees about the correctness of the generated reasoning paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Literature Review:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper reviews related work in prompting, natural language explanations, program synthesis and execution, numeric and logical reasoning, and the use of intermediate steps in neural networks.  It positions CoT prompting as a novel and effective approach, combining the strengths of previous methods while avoiding some of their limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the paper presents compelling evidence that CoT prompting is a simple yet powerful technique for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, especially when applied to large models.  The findings highlight the potential for using natural language as a mechanism for improving complex reasoning in artificial intelligence.\n"

The core methodology combines whole-proof generation with a novel Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) variant to leverage proof assistant feedback effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Literature Review:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper reviews existing approaches to language model-based theorem proving, categorizing them into two main strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Proof-step generation:**  Generates and verifies tactics sequentially, often using tree search. Examples include GPT-f, Thor, ReProver, Hypertree Proof Search, and InternLM2-StepProver.\n",
    "* **Whole-proof generation:** Generates the entire proof at once. Examples include DSP, Subgoal-Prover, LEGO-Prover, Lyra, and miniCTX.\n",
    "\n",
    "DeepSeek-Prover-V1, the predecessor, used whole-proof generation but suffered from the compounding error problem in long proofs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Methodology:**\n",
    "\n",
    "DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5 addresses the limitations of its predecessor through a three-stage training process and an enhanced inference method:\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.1. Model Training:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pre-training:** The base model (DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-Base) is pre-trained on a large dataset of mathematical text and code, focusing on formal languages like Lean, Isabelle, and Metamath.\n",
    "* **Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT):**  The pre-trained model is fine-tuned on an enhanced dataset derived from DeepSeek-Prover-V1.  This dataset is augmented in two ways:\n",
    "    * **Thought-augmented Proof Generation:**  Natural language chain-of-thought (CoT) comments are added to the Lean 4 code using DeepSeek-Coder V2 236B, aligning natural language reasoning with formal proof steps.\n",
    "    * **Prompt Augmentation with Tactic State Information:** Intermediate tactic states from the Lean 4 prover are inserted as comments within the code, allowing the model to utilize compiler feedback.  This is crucial for the truncate-and-resume mechanism.\n",
    "* **Reinforcement Learning from Proof Assistant Feedback (RLPAF):** The supervised fine-tuned model (DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-SFT) is further improved using the GRPO algorithm. The Lean prover provides binary rewards (1 for correct proofs, 0 for incorrect).  The authors address reward sparsity by focusing on challenging yet solvable problems for the SFT model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.2. Model Inference:**\n",
    "\n",
    "DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5 offers two inference methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Single-pass sampling:** Generates a whole proof and verifies it.  If incorrect, it repeats the process.\n",
    "* **RMaxTS (Reward-Max Tree Search):** A novel MCTS variant incorporating a truncate-and-resume mechanism and an intrinsic reward system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.2.1. RMaxTS Algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "RMaxTS uses a tactic-level tree abstraction where each node represents a tactic state transition. The algorithm consists of four steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Selection:** Uses a UCB1-based tree policy (Equation 1 and 2) modified for non-stationary rewards via a discounted UCB (DUCB, Equation 7-9).  The tree policy balances exploration and exploitation using a virtual node technique.\n",
    "* **Expansion:** The model generates a proof segment from the selected node. If an error occurs, it truncates the generated code at the error and adds the successful portion as new nodes to the tree.\n",
    "* **Simulation:** Integrated into expansion; the whole-proof generation acts as the simulation step.\n",
    "* **Backpropagation:** Updates the Q-values along the selected trajectory using extrinsic rewards (1 for correct proofs, 0 otherwise) and intrinsic rewards (1 if a new node is added to the tree, 0 otherwise, Equation 3).  DUCB is employed to handle non-stationary intrinsic rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is parallelized using root parallelization (multiple MCTS runners), tree parallelization (multiple thread workers), and a virtual loss technique to encourage exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Results and Evaluation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is evaluated on two benchmarks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **miniF2F:** High school level mathematics problems.\n",
    "* **ProofNet:** Undergraduate level mathematics problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metric used is pass@K (the percentage of problems solved correctly within K attempts).\n",
    "\n",
    "DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5 significantly outperforms DeepSeek-Prover-V1 and achieves state-of-the-art results on both benchmarks, especially when using RMaxTS.  The results show the effectiveness of each training stage (pre-training, SFT, RLPAF) and the benefits of the CoT prompting and RMaxTS.  Ablation studies confirm the importance of intrinsic rewards, discounted UCB, and tactic state information in RMaxTS.\n",

    "This paper introduces DeepSeekMath 7B, an open-source large language model (LLM) designed for superior mathematical reasoning capabilities.  It surpasses existing open-source models and approaches the performance of closed-source models like GPT-4 and Gemini-Ultra on various benchmarks.  The paper details its methodology, focusing on two key innovations: a high-quality, large-scale pre-training dataset and a novel reinforcement learning algorithm.\n",

It cites previous work on quantitative and geometric reasoning benchmarks and the use of LLMs for assisting in complex mathematical problem-solving.  The authors note the lack of publicly available, high-performing open-source models in this domain.\n",

    "* **Data Collection:** The core of the approach is the creation of the DeepSeekMath Corpus, a massive dataset of 120 billion math-related tokens.  This dataset is mined from Common Crawl using an iterative process:\n",
    "    * **Iteration 1:** A fastText classifier is trained using a seed corpus (OpenWebMath) for positive examples and randomly selected Common Crawl pages for negative examples. This classifier is used to filter Common Crawl for relevant pages.\n",
    "    * **Subsequent Iterations:**  The classifier is iteratively refined by identifying and manually annotating additional high-quality mathematical domains within Common Crawl, adding these to the seed corpus.  This iterative process continues until diminishing returns are observed (nearly 98% data collected in the 3rd iteration).  The final corpus consists of 35.5 million mathematical web pages.\n",
    "    * **Benchmark Decontamination:**  A crucial step involves removing any text segments from the corpus that overlap with established mathematical benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, CMATH, AGIEval) to prevent contamination.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Model Initialization and Pre-training:** DeepSeekMath-Base 7B is initialized using DeepSeek-Coder-Base-v1.5 7B (a pre-trained code model). The pre-training process involves continual learning on the DeepSeekMath Corpus, along with data from AlgebraicStack, arXiv, GitHub code, and general natural language data (English and Chinese). The rationale behind using a code-trained model is that it provides a better foundation for mathematical reasoning.\n",

    "\n",
    "DeepSeekMath-Base 7B undergoes SFT using a dataset of 776,000 examples, including English and Chinese problems with solutions in chain-of-thought (CoT), program-of-thought (PoT), and tool-integrated reasoning formats.

    "* **Unified paradigm for RL methods:**  The authors propose a unified framework to analyze different RL methods (SFT, RFT, DPO, PPO, GRPO), highlighting the roles of data source, reward function, and algorithm (gradient coefficient).\n",
    "* **RL improves robustness:** RL primarily enhances the model's ability to select the correct answer from the top K predictions (Maj@K) rather than fundamentally improving its reasoning capabilities.\n",

    "## Extensive Summary of \"Integrative Decoding: Improve Factuality via Implicit Self-consistency\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper introduces Integrative Decoding (ID), a novel decoding strategy designed to enhance the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs) in open-ended generation tasks.  The core idea is to implicitly incorporate self-consistency into the decoding process, overcoming limitations of existing self-consistency methods that often restrict task formats or are computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Literature Review and Problem Statement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper begins by highlighting the issue of \"hallucinations\" in LLMs – the generation of factually incorrect information.  Existing research demonstrates that repeated sampling, generating multiple outputs for the same prompt, significantly improves factuality.  Self-consistency (SC), measuring the consistency among these multiple outputs, serves as a valuable indicator of truthfulness.  However, most SC-based methods are limited to tasks with easily definable consistency (e.g., exact matches in multiple-choice questions or arithmetic problems).  The paper addresses the challenge of applying SC effectively to open-ended generation tasks, where consistency is more nuanced and difficult to quantify directly.  Existing attempts, like concatenating sampled responses into a single prompt for LLM evaluation (Universal Self-Consistency, or USC) or iteratively comparing facts across responses (Self-Contra), suffer from either excessive input length or computational inefficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Methodology:**\n",
    "\n",
    "ID proposes a different approach.  The methodology consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Repeated Sampling:** Generate *k* responses (\\(\\mathcal{R} = \\{r_1, r_2, ..., r_k\\}\\)) to a given prompt \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) using a sampling method like temperature or nucleus sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Input Construction:**  For each sampled response \\(r_j\\), create a new input \\(q_j\\) by concatenating the prompt, the response, and the prompt again:  \\([ \\mathbf{x}; r_j; \\mathbf{x} ]\\).  (Note: The paper clarifies that additional instructions, like \"Answer this question again,\" are added in practice to improve clarity, but are omitted in the formal notation for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Concurrent Processing:** Process all constructed inputs \\( \\mathcal{Q} = \\{q_1, q_2, ..., q_k\\}\\) concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Integrative Decoding:** At each decoding step *t*, instead of selecting the next token based on a single input's prediction, ID aggregates the logits (predicted probabilities) from all *k* models:\n",
    "\n",
    "   \\[\\hat{y}_t = \\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{y_t \\in \\mathcal{V}} \\sum_{r_j \\in \\mathcal{R}} \\log p_\\theta(y_t | y_{<t}, [\\mathbf{x}; r_j; \\mathbf{x}]) \\tag{8}\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "   where \\(\\hat{y}_t\\) is the selected token, \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) is the vocabulary, \\(y_{<t}\\) represents the previously generated tokens, and \\(p_\\theta\\) is the LLM's probability distribution parameterized by \\(\\theta\\).  This step implicitly integrates the self-consistency across all sampled responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Output:** The process continues until the end of sequence token is generated, resulting in a single output \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\) shared by all *k* parallel decoding processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper argues that this approach implicitly estimates a factuality score based on the consistency across responses.  The formula for factuality score of a statement \\(s_i\\) within a response \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\), considering other responses \\(\\mathcal{R}\\), is given as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[f(s_i) = \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{R}|} \\sum_{r_j \\in \\mathcal{R}} P(\\text{consistent} | s_i, r_j) \\tag{1}\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall factuality score of the response \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\) is then:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[F(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) = \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{S}| \\cdot |\\mathcal{R}|} \\sum_{s_i \\in \\mathcal{S}} \\sum_{r_j \\in \\mathcal{R}} P(\\text{consistent} | s_i, r_j) \\tag{2}\\]\n",
    "\n",

    "where \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) is the set of statements in \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\).  Equation (8) approximates this implicitly by leveraging the in-context learning ability of the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Experiments:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiments evaluate ID on three benchmarks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **TruthfulQA:**  Focuses on questions that humans often answer incorrectly due to misconceptions.  GPT-4 is used to assess truthfulness and informativeness. The metric is the product of Truth and Info scores (\\(T \\times I\\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Biographies:**  Involves generating bullet points summarizing the achievements of computer scientists. GPT-4 evaluates the factuality of each bullet point. Metrics include percentage accuracy (%Accuracy) and the number of correct statements (#Correct).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **LongFact-Objects:**  Requires generating long, detailed descriptions of objects.  LLaMA 3.1-70B-Instruct is used to split responses into atomic facts, with GPT-4 evaluating the truthfulness of each fact.  Metrics include Precision, Recall@128, and F1@128.\n",
    "\n",
    "ID is compared against greedy decoding, DoLa, USC, and Self-Reflection (SR). Experiments are conducted on six series of LLMs with varying scales (LLaMA-2-7B-chat, LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, Gemma-2-9B-it, Qwen2-7B-Instruct, and GLM-4-9B-chat).  Additional analysis is performed with various model sizes to evaluate scalability and robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Results and Discussion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The results show that ID consistently improves factuality across all LLMs and benchmarks, with substantial gains on TruthfulQA (+11.2%), Biographies (+15.4%), and LongFact (+8.5%). The performance gains increase as the number of sampled responses (*k*) increases, exhibiting a log-linear relationship.  In contrast, USC and SR fail to consistently improve with increasing *k*, often suffering from context length limitations. ID's advantage stems from its ability to implicitly integrate self-consistency without significantly increasing context length.  The method is shown to be robust across different sampling strategies and model scales.  A case study illustrates how ID maintains semantic-level self-consistency, filtering out hallucinations present even in the individual sampled responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrative Decoding offers a simple yet effective method for improving LLM factuality in open-ended generation.  Its implicit integration of self-consistency and its scalability make it a promising technique for enhancing the reliability of LLMs.  The code and data are publicly available.\n",

    "## Measuring Mathematical Problem Solving With the MATH Dataset: An Extensive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper introduces MATH, a new dataset designed to benchmark the mathematical problem-solving abilities of machine learning (ML) models, and AMPS, a large auxiliary pretraining dataset to improve model performance on MATH.  The research investigates the limitations of current large language models (LLMs) in tackling complex mathematical reasoning and proposes that algorithmic advancements, rather than simply scaling model size, are crucial for future progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Introduction and Motivation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper argues that while ML models excel at plug-and-chug calculations, true mathematical problem-solving—involving analysis, heuristic selection, and solution chaining—remains a significant challenge.  The authors highlight mathematics' broad applicability and its value as a testbed for evaluating general problem-solving capabilities in AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. The MATH Dataset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Content:** MATH comprises 12,500 high school competition mathematics problems (7,500 training, 5,000 test) from sources like the AMC 10, AMC 12, and AIME. Problems are designed to require sophisticated problem-solving techniques beyond simple formula application.\n",
    "* **Structure:** Each problem includes:\n",
    "    * A problem statement.\n",
    "    * A step-by-step solution in LaTeX and natural language.\n",
    "    * A final, boxed answer (uniquely formatted for automated evaluation).\n",
    "* **Categorization:** Problems are categorized by seven subjects (Prealgebra, Algebra, Number Theory, Counting & Probability, Geometry, Intermediate Algebra, Precalculus) and five difficulty levels (1-5).  This allows for granular performance analysis across subjects and difficulty.\n",
    "* **Formatting:** LaTeX and Asymptote (for diagrams) are used for consistent formatting, enabling automated evaluation with exact match accuracy.  Specific formatting rules are defined to handle equivalent representations of answers.\n",
    "* **Evaluation:**  Automatic assessment is possible due to the unique formatting of the final answer within a `\\boxed{}` LaTeX command. This allows for direct comparison with ground truth answers, accounting for various equivalent representations.\n",
    "* **Human Performance:**  Human performance on a sample of MATH problems ranged from 40% (a CS PhD student who dislikes math) to 90% (a three-time IMO gold medalist), highlighting the dataset's challenge even for humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. The AMPS Dataset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Content:** AMPS is a large-scale mathematics pretraining dataset (23GB) designed to improve model performance on MATH by providing foundational mathematical knowledge.\n",
    "* **Sources:** It combines:\n",
    "    * Over 100,000 problems and step-by-step solutions from Khan Academy (covering topics from basic arithmetic to advanced calculus).\n",
    "    * Approximately 5 million problems generated using 100 hand-designed Mathematica scripts, covering diverse mathematical areas (Table 1 in the paper lists a subset of these topics).  37 of these scripts also provide step-by-step solutions.\n",
    "* **Format:** Problems and solutions are formatted using LaTeX.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Experiments and Results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Models:** The experiments utilize autoregressive language models GPT-2 (with varying parameter counts) and GPT-3 (13B and 175B parameters).  Other models like T5 and BART were tested but showed less competitive results.\n",
    "* **Pretraining:**  GPT-2 models were pretrained on AMPS before fine-tuning on MATH. GPT-3 models were not pretrained on AMPS due to API limitations.\n",
    "* **Fine-tuning:** Models were fine-tuned to predict both final answers and full step-by-step solutions.\n",
    "* **Results (Table 2):**  Even the largest models achieved relatively low accuracy (3.0% - 6.9%), significantly below human performance.  Accuracy increased only modestly with model size, suggesting that simply increasing model size will not suffice to solve the MATH dataset.  Pretraining on AMPS significantly improved the performance of smaller GPT-2 models, allowing a 0.1B parameter model to perform comparably to a 13B parameter model without AMPS pretraining.\n",
    "* **Step-by-Step Solutions:**\n",
    "    * **Test-time generation:** Having models generate step-by-step solutions at test time *decreased* accuracy, potentially due to error propagation in the generation process.\n",
    "    * **Training-time use:** Providing step-by-step solutions during training *increased* accuracy by about 10%.\n",
    "    * **Hints:** Providing partial solutions as hints during inference improved accuracy (Figure 5), but still left significant room for improvement.  Even with 99% of the solution provided, accuracy was far from perfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Related Work:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper reviews existing datasets and approaches for mathematical reasoning in ML:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Neural Theorem Provers:** Benchmarks like Coq and HOList focus on formal theorem proving, which differs from the natural language problem-solving in MATH.\n",
    "* **Neural Calculators:** Datasets like DeepMind Mathematics focus on simpler, \"plug-and-chug\" problems, which are much easier than those in MATH.\n",
    "* **Benchmarks for Enormous Transformers:** The authors point out that current LLMs readily solve most existing natural language tasks through scaling, but MATH poses a unique challenge resistant to this approach.\n",

    "**6. Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper concludes that MATH provides a more challenging and realistic benchmark for mathematical problem-solving than existing datasets.  The authors emphasize the need for algorithmic innovations beyond simply scaling model size to achieve significant progress in solving complex mathematical problems.  The availability of step-by-step solutions in both MATH and AMPS provides opportunities for future research into improving model reasoning and interpretability.\n",

The benchmark addresses the limitations of existing datasets, which have become too easy for state-of-the-art models and lack the multimodal aspects often present in real-world scientific problem-solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Introduction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper highlights the impressive progress of LLMs and LMMs in various tasks, including text and code generation and mathematical reasoning. Models like GPT-4 and Gemini Ultra have surpassed human-level performance on several benchmarks. However, the authors argue that existing benchmarks in scientific reasoning, particularly in mathematics and physics, are insufficiently challenging for these advanced models.  They specifically mention datasets like GSM8K and MATH for mathematics, and SciQ, ScienceQA, and JEEBench for physics, noting that even sophisticated models achieve high accuracy on these. The lack of multimodal challenges is also identified as a significant shortcoming.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Related Work:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper reviews existing benchmarks for mathematical and physical reasoning, highlighting their limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Mathematics Benchmarks:** Datasets like GSM8K focus on elementary-level arithmetic problems.  More challenging datasets like MATH exist but are being quickly surpassed by advanced LLMs.  Theorem proving benchmarks also exist, but they often require translating natural language proofs into formal representations, a labor-intensive process.\n",
    "* **Physics Benchmarks:**  Benchmarks like SciQ and ScienceQA primarily consist of multiple-choice questions, lacking complex reasoning and computation. JEEBench offers multi-step reasoning but remains limited in scope.  SciEval and SciBench provide more challenging free-response questions, with SciBench including multimodal information.\n",
    "* **Multimodal Benchmarks:**  Datasets like Geometry3K and GeoQA focus on geometric problems with diagrams.  MMMU and CMMMU are multimodal, multi-disciplinary benchmarks but lack the focus on Olympiad-level difficulty.

    "## PEDAL: Enhancing Greedy Decoding with Large Language Models using Diverse Exemplars - An Extensive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper introduces PEDAL (**P**rompts based on **E**xemplar **D**iversity **A**ggregated using **LLMs**), a novel hybrid self-ensembling approach designed to improve the accuracy of text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) while reducing inference costs compared to existing methods.  The core idea is to combine the efficiency of Greedy Decoding with the robustness of self-ensembling techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Literature Review:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper reviews existing work in several key areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **LLMs and Reasoning:**  LLMs, despite their impressive capabilities (Brown et al., 2020; Raffel et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023), often require carefully crafted prompts for optimal performance (Khattab et al., 2023; Fernando et al., 2023).  Their reasoning abilities are a focus of ongoing research (Wei et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Self-Ensembling Strategies:**  Self-Consistency (SC) (Wang et al., 2022) generates diverse reasoning paths (\"Chain-of-Thought\" or CoT) and aggregates them to improve accuracy.  However, SC suffers from high inference costs due to the generation of numerous tokens and often relies on custom aggregation methods or a fixed answer set.  Universal Self-Consistency (USC) (Chen et al., 2023) addresses the aggregation problem by using the LLM itself to select the most consistent response.  Other related work includes tree-structured CoT (Long, 2023; Yao et al., 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Prompt Ensembling Strategies:** Several techniques focus on improving LLM performance through prompt ensembling (Zhang et al., 2023; Pitis et al., 2023; Singh et al., 2023; Arora et al., 2022; Hou et al., 2023).  Li et al. (2023b) notably used diverse exemplars within prompts, combined with diverse reasoning paths in SC, improving accuracy but still incurring high costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **LLM Inference Cost Reduction:**  Research into reducing LLM inference cost focuses on model compression (Zhu et al., 2024; Jacob et al., 2018; Cheng et al., 2024; Gou et al., 2021), efficient decoding (Shazeer, 2019; Wu et al., 2024), and early stopping strategies (Chen et al., 2023a).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Methodology:**\n",
    "\n",
    "PEDAL combines prompt ensembling and LLM-based aggregation to offer a balance between accuracy and efficiency.  The approach consists of two main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Prompts with Diverse Exemplars:**  Instead of a single prompt with fixed exemplars, PEDAL generates multiple prompts by randomly sampling exemplars for In-Context-Learning (ICL) using different random seeds. This induces diversity in the LLM's outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **LLM-based Aggregation:**  Following USC, PEDAL uses the same LLM to aggregate the candidate responses generated in the previous step.  The LLM effectively selects the most consistent answer among the candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Experiments:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Datasets:**  The experiments are conducted on two publicly available datasets:\n",
    "    * **SVAMP (Patel et al., 2021):** Elementary-level math word problems.\n",
    "    * **ARC-Challenge (Clark et al., 2018):**  A subset of the AI2 Reasoning Challenge, containing more difficult questions.  The paper uses a randomly sampled 30% of the ARC-Challenge dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Baselines:**  The following baselines are used for comparison:\n",
    "    * **Greedy Decoding:**  Standard Greedy Decoding.\n",
    "    * **Self-Consistency (SC):**  Standard Self-Consistency with CoT prompting.\n",
    "    * **Unified Diverse Exemplars (UDE):**  All diverse exemplars are combined into a single prompt, then Greedy Decoding is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Models & Settings:**  Experiments use Qwen2-7B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2024) and Llama-3-8B-Instruct (Touvron et al., 2023) LLMs, with 4-bit quantization.  Three random seeds are used for reproducibility.  Three exemplars are selected per prompt.  For USC, three intermediate outputs are generated. For PEDAL, three diverse prompts are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Results and Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Results are presented in Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5.  Key findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Accuracy:** PEDAL consistently outperforms Greedy Decoding in terms of accuracy on both datasets.  While USC sometimes achieves higher accuracy, PEDAL's accuracy is competitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inference Cost:** PEDAL significantly reduces the number of output tokens compared to USC, resulting in lower inference cost.  The number of input tokens is slightly higher for PEDAL than for USC in some cases.  The paper compares the output token counts of PEDAL and CoT (a single intermediate output from SC), indicating that PEDAL is often more cost-efficient, especially with Llama3.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Impact of Number of Diverse Prompts:** Table 6 shows that increasing the number of diverse prompts from 2 to 4 leads to slight improvements in accuracy for the SVAMP dataset but shows no consistent pattern for the ARC dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "PEDAL effectively enhances Greedy Decoding, providing a trade-off between the accuracy of self-ensembling and the cost-efficiency of Greedy Decoding. The paper showcases the advantages of combining diverse exemplars in prompts with LLM-based aggregation for improved performance and reduced inference cost. Future work includes exploring its application to larger datasets and more complex free-form text generation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Formulas and Notation:**  The paper does not present any complex mathematical formulas or notations beyond basic statistical measures like accuracy and standard deviation reported in tables (e.g.,  \"83.38 ± 0.55\").  The core methodology is algorithmic rather than mathematically formal.\n",

    "\n",

    "## Extensive Summary of \"Program of Thoughts Prompting: Disentangling Computation from Reasoning for Numerical Reasoning Tasks\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper introduces \"Program of Thoughts\" (PoT), a prompting method designed to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) on numerical reasoning tasks.  The core idea is to separate the reasoning process from the computational process, delegating the latter to an external program interpreter (Python in this case). This contrasts with the existing state-of-the-art method, \"Chain of Thoughts\" (CoT), which uses the LLM for both reasoning and computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Literature Review:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper reviews existing work on numerical reasoning in NLP, focusing on:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Datasets:**  The authors mention several benchmark datasets for mathematical word problems (MWPs) (GSM8K, AQuA, SVAMP, TabMWP, MultiArith) and financial question answering (FinQA, ConvFinQA, TATQA).  These datasets vary in input format (text, tables, conversations) and difficulty.\n",
    "* **Traditional Methods:** Earlier methods involved training models from scratch or fine-tuning them on datasets with annotated reasoning steps. These are data-intensive.\n",
    "* **Chain of Thoughts (CoT):** CoT leverages the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs. By providing a few input-output examples with intermediate reasoning steps (the \"chain of thoughts\"), the LLM learns to generate similar rationales and answers for new problems.  However, the paper argues that LLMs are not well-suited for complex computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Methodology: Program of Thoughts (PoT)**\n",
    "\n",
    "PoT addresses the limitations of CoT by separating reasoning and computation.  The LLM generates a program (in Python) that expresses the reasoning steps, and this program is then executed by a Python interpreter to obtain the final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Key Differences from CoT:** PoT uses a programming language to represent reasoning steps, allowing for more efficient and accurate computation, especially for iterative processes and complex mathematical expressions (e.g., solving polynomial equations).  CoT relies on the LLM to perform all calculations, leading to potential errors and inefficiency.\n",
    "* **PoT Prompting:** The paper describes both few-shot and zero-shot PoT prompting.  Few-shot prompting provides the LLM with examples of (question, Python program) pairs. Zero-shot prompting only includes instructions, relying on the LLM's learned capabilities.  A key aspect of zero-shot PoT is suppressing the '#' token (comment symbol in Python) to encourage code generation rather than natural language reasoning within comments.\n",
    "* **PoT with CoT (Hybrid Approach):** For some problems requiring both computational and textual reasoning, the authors propose a hybrid approach.  PoT handles the computation, generating an intermediate result. This result is then fed back into a CoT prompt to derive the final answer.  This is particularly useful for problems where the computational result needs further interpretation (e.g., converting hours to a time format).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Experimental Setup:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Datasets:** The experiments cover the aforementioned MWP and financial datasets.  Table inputs are linearized into text strings.\n",
    "* **Models:** Primarily uses OpenAI Codex (code-davinci-002), with ablation studies using GPT-3, ChatGPT, CodeGen, CodeT5+, and XGen.\n",
    "* **Evaluation Metrics:** Exact match for numerical answers, with appropriate rounding and tolerance levels.  Official evaluation scripts are used where available.\n",
    "* **Baselines:** Codex, GPT-3, PaLM (results from previous work), CoT, and CoT with an external calculator (CoT + calc).\n",
    "* **Decoding Methods:** Greedy decoding and self-consistency (SC) decoding (majority vote over multiple generations).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Results and Outcomes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The results are presented in Tables 2 and 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Few-shot:** PoT consistently outperforms CoT across all datasets, with an average gain of around 8% on MWP datasets and 15% on financial datasets.  The improvement is more significant for datasets with complex computations or large numbers.  PoT + SC further improves performance.\n",
    "* **Few-shot + Self-Consistency:**  PoT + SC achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results on all MWP datasets and near SoTA on financial datasets, often surpassing even CoT with an external calculator.\n",
    "* **Zero-shot:** Zero-shot PoT significantly outperforms zero-shot CoT on MWP datasets, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Table 4 shows the impact of different LLMs on PoT's performance.  gpt-3.5-turbo outperformed Codex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tables 5 and 6 present ablation studies showing the importance of semantic binding of variables and the multi-step nature of PoT for better performance.  Figure 6 shows a breakdown of performance across different question types in AQuA, indicating PoT's superiority on more complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 7 illustrates examples of value grounding errors and logic generation errors in PoT.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Conclusion and Discussion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors conclude that PoT effectively separates reasoning and computation, leading to improved performance on numerical reasoning tasks. They suggest PoT's suitability for problems requiring symbolic reasoning, while acknowledging limitations, such as potential safety risks of executing generated code and challenges with highly diverse problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Formulas and Notations (Illustrative examples):**\n",
    "\n",
    "While the paper doesn't present many explicit mathematical formulas, the underlying concepts involve:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simple arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) used within the generated Python programs.\n",
    "* Solving equations (e.g., using SymPy library in Python).  The paper uses symbolic representations (e.g.,  `solve_it(equations, variable)`) to denote equation solving within the Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Snippets (Illustrative examples):**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper provides several examples of Python code generated by the LLM using PoT. Here's a simplified representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example from the paper\n",
    "total_eggs = 16\n",
    "eaten_eggs = 3\n",

    "dollars_per_egg = 2\n",
    "ans = sold_eggs * dollars_per_egg \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "More complex examples involve using SymPy for symbolic calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the paper presents a novel and effective approach to improve LLM performance on numerical reasoning tasks.  PoT offers a significant improvement over CoT by delegating computation to an external interpreter, resulting in more accurate and efficient solutions, particularly for complex problems.  The ablation studies and detailed analysis provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of this approach.\n"

    "\n",
    "This paper introduces Putnam-AXIOM, a benchmark designed to evaluate the higher-level mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).  It addresses the saturation of existing benchmarks and the problem of data contamination, where LLMs might achieve high scores by memorizing problems from their training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Literature Review:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper reviews existing mathematical reasoning benchmarks like MATH and GSM8K, highlighting their limitations due to LLM performance saturation.  It discusses the growing concern of data contamination, where models memorize answers from publicly available datasets.  Related work on combating this issue, such as the creation of functional variations (Srivastava et al., 2024), and other contemporary datasets like ARB, OlympiadBench, and SciBench are also discussed, highlighting their limitations in terms of automatic evaluation and scalability.  PutnamBench, focusing on formal theorem proving, is also mentioned as a related, but distinct, approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Methodology:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Putnam-AXIOM comprises two datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Putnam-AXIOM Original:** This dataset consists of 236 problems from the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition (1985-2023), selected for their suitability for automated evaluation.  Problems are categorized into 11 domains (Geometry, Algebra, Trigonometry, Calculus, Linear Algebra, Combinatorics, Probability, Number Theory, Complex Numbers, Differential Equations, and Analysis) and by difficulty level (A/B for sitting, 1-6 for increasing complexity within a sitting).  Solutions are provided with boxed final answers (`\\boxed{}`) for automated evaluation.  Some problems were modified to ensure a single, easily extractable boxed answer, preserving the core difficulty while simplifying evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Putnam-AXIOM Variation:** This dataset contains functional variations of 52 problems from the original dataset.  Variations are generated programmatically by:\n",
    "    * **Variable Change:** Altering variable names.\n",
    "    * **Constant Change:** Modifying numerical constants in the problem statement and solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "These variations create an effectively infinite supply of novel, equally challenging problems, mitigating data contamination.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Algorithms and Formulas:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper doesn't present novel algorithms. The core methodology relies on:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Automated Evaluation:**  LLM responses are evaluated by extracting the boxed answer and comparing it to the ground truth using an equivalence function. This function handles variations in answer representation (e.g., 0.5, 1/2, ½).\n",
    "* **Functional Variation Generation:** A simple algorithmic process to modify variables and constants in the original problems to produce variations.  No specific formulas are presented for this, as the changes are problem-specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Notation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\\boxed{}`:  Indicates the boxed final answer in the problem solutions.\n",
    "* \\(F_m\\): The m-th Fibonacci number.\n",
    "* \\(p(x)\\): A polynomial.\n",
    "* \\(\\Gamma(p(x))\\): The sum of squares of the coefficients of polynomial \\(p(x)\\).\n",
    "* \\(i\\): The imaginary unit (\\(i^2 = -1\\)).\n",
    "* \\(\\lfloor a \\rfloor\\): The floor function (largest integer less than or equal to \\(a\\)).\n",
    "* \\(|z|\\): The magnitude (absolute value) of a complex number \\(z\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Results and Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper evaluates several LLMs (OpenAI's o1-preview, GPT-4, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-Math-7B, Qwen2-Math-7B-Instruct, NuminaMath, NuminaMath-7B-TIR, and DeepSeek-Math-7B-RL) on both datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Putnam-AXIOM Original:** OpenAI's o1-preview achieved the highest accuracy (41.95%), while other models scored significantly lower (mostly below 10%).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Putnam-AXIOM Variation:**  All models showed a significant drop in accuracy compared to their performance on the corresponding original problems (20-44% reduction). This demonstrates the effectiveness of the variations in revealing the models' reliance on memorization.  The confidence intervals for many models indicated statistically significant differences between original and variation performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error analysis focused on OpenAI o1-preview and GPT-4o, revealing a common weakness: lack of mathematical rigor in their solutions.  While often reaching the correct final answer, these models frequently lacked justification for intermediate steps.  Open-source models exhibited additional errors like calculation mistakes, hallucinations, and misunderstandings of the problem statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "A further analysis on binary questions (questions with only two possible answers) showed that their inclusion inflated the accuracy scores of some models, especially less-advanced ones, but this effect was less prominent for the top-performing models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Putnam-AXIOM provides a challenging benchmark for evaluating advanced mathematical reasoning in LLMs. The use of functional variations effectively mitigates data contamination issues. The results highlight the limitations of current LLMs in tackling complex, high-level mathematical problems and underscore the need for further research in artificial reasoning.  The data and evaluation code are publicly available.\n",

    "\n",
    "The summary mentions several tables and figures from the paper which illustrate the performance of different LLMs on the original and variation datasets, as well as examples of model errors and the analysis of binary questions versus complex questions.  These visuals are crucial for a full understanding of the results but cannot be reproduced here without access to the original paper's figures.  The paper mentions Figure 1 contrasting original and variation accuracies with confidence intervals, Table 1 showing Putnam-AXIOM Original dataset accuracies, and Table 2 presenting mean accuracies and confidence intervals for the Putnam-AXIOM Variation dataset.  Figures 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 illustrate examples of modified questions and model responses.  Figure 6 compares overall accuracies on Putnam-AXIOM with and without binary questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Legal Compliance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper includes an appendix discussing the legal compliance of using Putnam problems, arguing that their use falls under fair use due to transformative nature of the dataset, non-commercial purpose, and the negligible effect on the market for Putnam problems.\n"

    "## Extensive Summary of \"PutnamBench: A Multilingual Competition-Mathematics Benchmark for Formal Theorem-Proving\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper introduces PutnamBench, a new multilingual benchmark for evaluating formal theorem-proving algorithms.  It leverages problems from the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, a prestigious undergraduate-level mathematics competition. The benchmark aims to push the boundaries of automated theorem proving by providing challenging problems requiring diverse mathematical knowledge and skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Introduction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper highlights the growing need for robust benchmarks in automated mathematical reasoning, particularly with the rise of neural theorem provers. Existing benchmarks like MiniF2F (high school level) and Fimo (IMO shortlist problems) have limitations: MiniF2F contains easily solvable problems, and Fimo only supports the now-deprecated Lean 3.  PutnamBench addresses these limitations by offering a collection of formally verified problems from the Putnam competition, known for its challenging problems spanning various undergraduate mathematics topics.  The authors also emphasize the importance of preventing data leakage between training and evaluation sets in the age of LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Background:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Formal Theorem Proving:** The paper explains the core concepts of interactive theorem provers (ITPs) like Lean 4, Coq, and Isabelle. These systems allow users to formally state theorems and construct machine-verifiable proofs through a sequence of proof steps, transforming the initial proof state to a final \"QED\" state.  Figure 1 in the paper illustrates a Lean 4 theorem and its proof.\n",
    "* **The Putnam Competition:** The paper describes the Putnam competition, emphasizing its breadth of mathematical topics (analysis, linear algebra, abstract algebra, number theory, geometry, set theory, and combinatorics) and its difficulty, making it a suitable source for a challenging benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. PutnamBench:**\n",
    "\n",
    "PutnamBench contains formalizations of 514 Putnam problems in Lean 4 and Isabelle, with an additional 309 in Coq, totaling 1337 formalizations. Key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Diversity and Breadth:** Unlike previous benchmarks focusing primarily on high school mathematics, PutnamBench covers a wider range of undergraduate-level mathematical concepts.\n",
    "* **Multilinguality:**  It's the first benchmark to offer formalizations across Lean 4, Isabelle, and Coq, enabling cross-ITP comparisons and facilitating research in multilingual theorem proving.  The formalizations are structurally aligned but may differ due to the underlying foundations of each language.  The use of different mathematical libraries (Mathlib for Lean, HOL for Isabelle, Coquelicot and others for Coq) also impacts the formalizations.\n",
    "* **Factored Solutions:**  Approximately 60% of Putnam problems require finding a closed-form solution before proving its correctness.  PutnamBench addresses this by offering two tasks: (1) finding the solution and then proving it, and (2) proving a given solution. This better reflects the true difficulty of the original problems.\n",
    "* **Licensing:** The benchmark is released under Apache 2.0 (Lean 4 and Isabelle) and MIT (Coq) licenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Experimental Evaluation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors evaluate several neural and symbolic theorem provers on PutnamBench:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Models:** GPT-4 (used across all languages), Copra (Lean 4 and Coq), Draft-Sketch-Prove (DSP) (Isabelle), Sledgehammer (Isabelle), and CoqHammer (Coq).\n",
    "* **Metrics:** The `pass@n` metric is used, measuring the success rate within `n` proof attempts.\n",
    "* **Results:** The overall results are quite poor, demonstrating the significant challenge PutnamBench presents.  Only a handful of problems were solved across all languages and methods:\n",
    "    * **Lean 4:** GPT-4 solved only one problem (Putnam 1988 B1); Copra, with modifications for Lean 4, also solved only one (Putnam 1988 B1).\n",
    "    * **Isabelle:** GPT-4 failed to solve any problems; DSP solved two; Sledgehammer solved three (all involving sets with binary operations).\n",
    "    * **Coq:** GPT-4 solved one problem (Putnam 1988 B1); Copra solved one (Putnam 1988 B1); CoqHammer solved none.  Figure 2, 3, and 13 show examples of formalizations and proofs.\n",
    "* **General Analysis:** The successfully solved problems were generally among the easiest in the benchmark, highlighting the current limitations of automated theorem provers in handling complex, multi-concept problems.  The authors point to two main reasons for the failures: (i) Difficulty in synthesizing new lemmas and complex proof strategies, and (ii) Inefficient leveraging of knowledge within existing mathematical repositories.  Figures 15-21 illustrate various aspects of the evaluation, including prompt engineering, error messages, and successful/failed proof attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Related Works:**\n",

    "\n",
    "The paper reviews existing work on PLMs, highlighting their limitations in accessing and manipulating knowledge precisely, leading to \"hallucinations\" (factual inaccuracies). While some previous work explored hybrid models combining parametric and non-parametric memory, they primarily focused on extractive question answering. RAG addresses this gap by extending the hybrid approach to seq2seq models, enabling more flexible and abstractive generation. The authors distinguish their work from prior memory-augmented architectures by using pre-trained components, avoiding the need for training the access mechanism from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology:**\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG uses two main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retriever (DPR):**  A pre-trained bi-encoder model that maps queries (x) and documents (z) into dense vector spaces.  The probability of retrieving document z given query x is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $p_{\\eta}(z|x) \\propto \\exp\\left(\\mathbf{d}(z)^{\\top}\\mathbf{q}(x)\\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "   where $\\mathbf{d}(z) = \\text{BERT}_{d}(z)$ and $\\mathbf{q}(x) = \\text{BERT}_{q}(x)$ are the document and query embeddings generated by BERT-based encoders.  Retrieval involves finding the top-K documents with the highest probability scores using Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generator (BART):** A pre-trained seq2seq transformer model that generates the target sequence (y) conditioned on the input (x) and the retrieved documents (z). The probability of generating the i-th token is:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $p_{\\theta}(y_{i}|x,z,y_{1:i-1})$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper proposes two RAG model formulations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **RAG-Sequence:** Uses the same retrieved document (z) to generate the entire output sequence (y). The probability of generating the sequence is approximated by:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $p_{\\text{RAG-Sequence}}(y|x) \\approx \\sum_{z \\in \\text{top-}k(p(\\cdot|x))} p_{\\eta}(z|x) \\prod_{i} p_{\\theta}(y_{i}|x,z,y_{1:i-1})$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **RAG-Token:** Allows different documents to be used for generating different tokens in the output sequence. The probability is approximated by:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $p_{\\text{RAG-Token}}(y|x) \\approx \\prod_{i}^{N} \\sum_{z \\in \\text{top-}k(p(\\cdot|x))} p_{\\eta}(z|x) p_{\\theta}(y_{i}|x,z,y_{1:i-1})$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training:**\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG models are trained end-to-end by minimizing the negative marginal log-likelihood of the target sequence given the input, treating the retrieved documents as latent variables.  Only the query encoder and the BART generator are fine-tuned; the document encoder and index remain fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decoding:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Different decoding strategies are employed for RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token. RAG-Sequence uses beam search for each retrieved document and then combines the results, employing either \"Through Decoding\" (expensive) or \"Fast Decoding\" (approximative) methods. RAG-Token uses standard autoregressive decoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Experiments and Results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors evaluate RAG on a range of knowledge-intensive tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Open-domain Question Answering (QA):** RAG achieves state-of-the-art results on Natural Questions, TriviaQA, WebQuestions, and CuratedTrec, outperforming both parametric-only and task-specific retrieve-and-extract models.  Even on extractive QA tasks, generation outperforms extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Abstractive QA (MS-MARCO):** RAG outperforms a BART baseline in terms of BLEU and ROUGE scores, generating more factual and less hallucinated answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Jeopardy Question Generation:** RAG (particularly RAG-Token) surpasses BART in terms of Q-BLEU and human evaluation (factuality and specificity).  The results suggest that RAG-Token's ability to use different documents for different tokens is beneficial for this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fact Verification (FEVER):** RAG achieves performance within a small margin of state-of-the-art pipeline models, without explicit retrieval supervision.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ablation Studies:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ablation studies show that learned retrieval significantly improves performance across tasks compared to using a fixed BM25 retriever or freezing the retriever during training.  The ability to \"hot-swap\" the knowledge base (by replacing the Wikipedia index) is also demonstrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discussion and Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper concludes that RAG effectively combines parametric and non-parametric memory for enhanced knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results and generating more factual, specific, and diverse outputs compared to parametric-only models.  Future work could explore joint pre-training of the retriever and generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Broader Impact:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors acknowledge the positive societal benefits of RAG (factual accuracy, interpretability) but also discuss potential downsides, such as the propagation of biases from the knowledge base and the potential for misuse in generating misleading or harmful content.  They suggest the use of AI systems to mitigate these risks.  The code is open-sourced via HuggingFace Transformers.\n"

    "This paper, \"Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models,\" introduces a novel decoding strategy called self-consistency to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).  The core idea builds upon chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, a technique that encourages LLMs to generate intermediate reasoning steps before arriving at a final answer.  The paper argues that while CoT prompting improves reasoning, it can be further improved by leveraging the inherent diversity of reasoning paths leading to a correct solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Literature Review:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper reviews existing literature on reasoning in LLMs, highlighting the limitations of solely increasing model scale to improve reasoning abilities. It mentions previous work on chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022), which demonstrated significant improvements in multi-step reasoning tasks.  The authors also discuss existing decoding strategies like greedy decoding, temperature sampling, top-k sampling, and nucleus sampling, as well as re-ranking methods that use additional verifiers or human annotations to improve generation quality (Cobbe et al., 2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022).  The paper contrasts self-consistency with these methods, emphasizing its unsupervised nature and lack of need for additional training or data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the methodology is the self-consistency decoding strategy.  It consists of three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CoT Prompting:**  The LLM is prompted with a question and a few manually written examples demonstrating chain-of-thought reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Diverse Path Sampling:** Instead of using greedy decoding (selecting the single most likely next token at each step), the model samples multiple reasoning paths from its decoder.  This leverages various sampling techniques like temperature sampling, top-k sampling, and nucleus sampling, with parameters tuned for each model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Answer Marginalization:** The sampled reasoning paths, each potentially leading to a different answer (denoted as  $\\mathbf{a}_{i} \\in \\mathbb{A}$, where  $i = 1, \\dots, m$ indexes the  $m$ samples), are analyzed. The final answer is chosen by marginalizing out the reasoning paths and selecting the most frequent answer (a majority vote).  The paper also explores weighted averaging and weighted summation using the unnormalized or normalized probabilities of generating each path and answer pair:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $P(\\mathbf{r}_{i},\\mathbf{a}_{i}\\mid\\text{prompt},\\text{question})=\\exp^{\\frac{1 }{R}\\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\log P(t_{k}|\\text{prompt},\\text{question},t_{1},\\ldots,t_{ k-1})}$ (Equation 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "   where  $\\mathbf{r}_{i}$ represents the reasoning path,  $t_{k}$ is the  $k$-th token,  $K$ is the total number of tokens, and  $R$ is a normalization factor (used for the normalized version).  The paper finds that the unweighted sum (majority vote) performs comparably to the normalized weighted sum, suggesting the model doesn't reliably distinguish between correct and incorrect reasoning paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Experiments and Results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper evaluates self-consistency on several arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks, including:\n",

    "* **Arithmetic Reasoning:** GSM8K, SVAMP, AQuA, AddSub, MultiArith, ASDiv\n",
    "* **Commonsense Reasoning:** CommonsenseQA, StrategyQA, ARC-challenge\n",
    "* **Symbolic Reasoning:** Last letter concatenation, Coinflip\n",
    "\n",
    "Four LLMs of varying scales are used: UL2-20B, GPT-3-175B, LaMDA-137B, and PaLM-540B.  The results (Tables 2 and 3) consistently show that self-consistency significantly improves accuracy compared to CoT prompting with greedy decoding across all models and tasks.  The improvement is more pronounced for larger models.  Self-consistency achieves state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks.  Figure 2 shows that accuracy generally increases with the number of sampled paths. Table 4 provides illustrative examples where self-consistency corrects errors made by greedy decoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional experiments demonstrate that self-consistency:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Improves robustness to imperfect prompts:** Even with noisy prompts, self-consistency maintains performance better than greedy decoding.\n",
    "* **Works with different sampling strategies:** The improvement is relatively consistent across different sampling parameters.\n",
    "* **Outperforms other approaches:** Self-consistency surpasses sample-and-rank, beam search, and ensemble methods.  Table 7 shows its superiority over prompt-order and multi-prompt ensemble techniques.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Discussion and Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper concludes that self-consistency is a simple yet effective method for boosting the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.  It highlights the benefits beyond improved accuracy, such as providing rationales and uncertainty estimates. The authors acknowledge the increased computational cost but suggest using a smaller number of sampling paths to mitigate this.  They also mention the need for future work to address issues like generating nonsensical reasoning paths and improving model calibration and factuality.  The reproducibility statement notes that two of the four models used (UL2 and GPT-3) are publicly available.\n",

    "This paper, \"Self-Para-Consistency: Improving Reasoning Tasks at Low Cost for Large Language Models,\" introduces a novel method to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) while significantly reducing computational costs compared to existing techniques.

Program-of-Thought (PoT) prompting is mentioned as an alternative to address inconsistency issues, but the focus remains on improving the efficiency of the self-consistency approach.  The authors also discuss the inherent quality-diversity trade-off in text generation and how prior work attempts to address it by manipulating parameters or sampling latent variables.  They propose leveraging paraphrase generation to achieve diversity without sacrificing quality by using greedy decoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed method, **Self-Para-Consistency**, tackles the cost issue by replacing the expensive sampling process with paraphrase generation. The methodology consists of three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Paraphrasing:**  Given a question, *x*, the LLM (parameterized by θ) generates *k-1* paraphrases, denoted as  \\(G_{para} = \\{x'_1, x'_2, ..., x'_{k-1}\\}\\). This process is formalized as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   \\[\\mathcal{P}_{\\theta}(G_{para} \\mid x, \\mathcal{I}_{para}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{k-1} \\mathcal{P}_{\\theta}(x'_i \\mid x, \\mathcal{I}_{para}, G^{<i}_{para}) \\tag{1}\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "   where \\(\\mathcal{I}_{para}\\) is the prompt instructing the LLM to generate paraphrases, and \\(G^{<i}_{para}\\) represents the set of paraphrases generated before the *i*-th paraphrase.  Sequential generation encourages diversity in the paraphrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reasoning Path Generation:**  The LLM generates reasoning paths, \\(R_{path} = \\{r_1, r_2, ..., r_k\\}\\), for the original question and its *k-1* paraphrases using greedy decoding.  This step is formalized as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   \\[\\mathcal{P}_{\\theta}(R_{path} \\mid x, G_{para}, \\mathcal{I}_{inst}) = \\mathcal{P}_{\\theta}(r_1 \\mid x, \\mathcal{I}_{inst}) \\cdot \\prod_{i=1}^{k-1} \\mathcal{P}_{\\theta}(r_{i+1} \\mid x'_i, \\mathcal{I}_{inst}) \\tag{2}\\]\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Answer Aggregation:**  Each reasoning path, \\(r_i\\), yields an answer, \\(a_i\\).  The final answer is determined by majority voting among the \\(a_i\\):\n",

    "The authors evaluate their method on six reasoning datasets: three in-distribution datasets (GSM8K, SVAMP, ASDIV) and three out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets (GSM8K-hard, a modified GSM8K with larger numbers; and a date understanding dataset from BIG-bench).  They compare Self-Para-Consistency with several baselines, including Zero-Shot-PAL (Program-Aided Language Models) and Self-Consistency with varying temperatures and sampling numbers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Table 1** presents results for numerical reasoning datasets. Self-Para-Consistency (*k*=3) generally outperforms the baselines, particularly on the OOD GSM8K-hard dataset.\n",
    "* **Table 2** shows results for the date understanding dataset. Again, Self-Para-Consistency achieves the highest accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results demonstrate that Self-Para-Consistency achieves comparable or better accuracy than Self-Consistency with a significantly smaller number of reasoning paths (k=3 vs. k=5 or k=10), thus achieving lower computational cost.\n",

By leveraging paraphrase generation instead of extensive sampling, it achieves comparable or better accuracy with substantially reduced computational overhead.

    "## Extensive Summary of \"Soft Self-Consistency Improves Language Model Agents\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper introduces Soft Self-Consistency (Soft-SC), an improved method for selecting the best output from multiple samples generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) acting as an agent in interactive tasks.  The authors address limitations of the existing Self-Consistency (SC) method, particularly its inefficiency in scenarios with numerous valid actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Literature Review and Problem Statement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper builds upon the success of Self-Consistency (SC) (Wang et al., 2023), which enhances LLM performance by generating multiple solutions (using chain-of-thought prompting) and selecting the answer via majority voting. However, SC's reliance on exact matching for voting proves inefficient in interactive tasks with large, diverse action spaces.  In such settings, the probability of identical actions across multiple samples is low, requiring a prohibitively large number of samples for reliable selection.  The authors cite a specific example where, with only five samples, SC fails to produce a majority action 86% of the time in a bash program prediction task.  This inefficiency motivates the development of Soft-SC.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Methodology:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Soft-SC proposes a continuous relaxation of the discrete majority voting approach used in SC.  Instead of relying on exact matches, Soft-SC scores each generated action based on the aggregated probabilities of its constituent tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.1 Soft Self-Consistency (Soft-SC) Algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input:** A task description  `x`.\n",
    "2. **Sampling:** Generate `k` solutions using temperature-based sampling (Ackley et al., 1985; Ficler and Goldberg, 2017), resulting in actions `y₁, y₂, ..., yₖ`. Each `yᵢ` is a sequence of tokens.\n",
    "3. **Scoring:** For each action `yᵢ` composed of tokens `yᵢ₁, yᵢ₂, ..., yᵢₙ`, compute its score using one of the following aggregation functions:\n",
    "    * **Mean:**  `score(yᵢ) = (1/n) * Σᵢ P(yᵢⱼ | yᵢ<ⱼ, x)`\n",
    "    * **Min:** `score(yᵢ) = minᵢ P(yᵢⱼ | yᵢ<ⱼ, x)`\n",
    "    * **Product:** `score(yᵢ) = exp((1/n) * Σᵢ log P(yᵢⱼ | yᵢ<ⱼ, x))`  (where `P(yᵢⱼ | yᵢ<ⱼ, x)` is the model's probability of token `yᵢⱼ` given previous tokens and the input `x`). The best-performing function is chosen based on the development set for each task.\n",
    "4. **Selection:** Choose the action with the highest score:  `ŷ = argmaxⱼ score(yⱼ)`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.2 Adaptive Soft Self-Consistency:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To enhance efficiency, the authors adapt the idea of adaptive consistency (Aggarwal et al., 2023).  Instead of generating a fixed number of samples `k`, Soft-SC adaptively samples actions until a cumulative score threshold τ is met.  The threshold τ is determined based on development set performance.  Specifically, sampling stops when:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Σⱼ₌₁ᵏ minᵢ P(yⱼᵢ | yⱼ<ᵢ, x) ≥ τ`\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.3 Datasets:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper evaluates Soft-SC on three diverse interactive LLM agent datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Bash:**  (Yang et al., 2023) Involves generating bash commands to fulfill user instructions. Success is measured by the success rate (1.0 reward).\n",
    "* **WebShop:** (Yao et al., 2022) A simulated online shopping environment where the agent interacts with a website to buy products. Performance is measured by success rate (perfect score of 1) and average score (0 to 1).\n",
    "* **ALFWorld:** (Shridhar et al., 2021) A text-based game simulating household tasks where the agent performs a sequence of actions to achieve a goal. Success is measured by success rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Results and Discussion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiments compare Soft-SC against several baselines: Greedy Decoding (single sample), Self-Consistency (SC), and Adaptive Consistency (AC).  Key findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Superior Performance:** For the same number of samples (`k`), Soft-SC consistently outperforms SC across all datasets.  Improvements range from 1.3% to 6.6% in success rate.\n",
    "* **Improved Sample Efficiency:** Soft-SC achieves comparable or better performance than SC with significantly fewer samples.  Figure 1 visually demonstrates this improved scaling with `k`.\n",
    "* **Better Scaling with Model Size:** Soft-SC shows better scaling with increasing model size than SC (Figure 2).\n",
    "* **Effective with Black-Box Models:** Soft-SC can be applied to black-box models by using a smaller, open-source LLM to score the outputs of the black-box model (Figure 3).  This allows for efficient reranking even without access to the black-box model's logits.\n",
    "* **Calibration Not Crucial:**  The authors find that model calibration (measured by ECE and AUROC) does not strongly correlate with Soft-SC's performance (Appendix B), suggesting its robustness.\n",
    "* **Logit-based Scores Superior:**  Logit-based scores outperform verbalized confidence scores (Table 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.  Limitations and Broader Impacts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Diversity Dependence:** Both SC and Soft-SC require some diversity in the generated samples; identical samples provide no benefit.\n",
    "* **Computational Cost:** Soft-SC, like other sample-and-select methods, incurs a higher computational cost than greedy decoding.\n",
    "* **Ethical Considerations:**  The improved LLM performance could be used for malicious purposes, highlighting the need for responsible development and deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper successfully demonstrates that Soft-SC improves both the performance and sample efficiency of LLMs acting as agents in interactive tasks. Its continuous scoring mechanism addresses the limitations of SC in domains with high action diversity and its adaptability to both white-box and black-box models makes it a valuable contribution to the field.\n",

Each chain consists of intermediate results (states) `x<sub>i</sub><sup>j</sup>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Step 4: Overlapping State Identification:**  The algorithm identifies intermediate results that appear across multiple reasoning chains.  This is done by converting intermediate results into TF-IDF vectors and computing cosine similarity.  Results with similarity above a threshold (T=0.999) are considered overlapping. A human-in-the-loop (HITL) option allows human experts to select overlapping states.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Step 5: Verification:**  A verification function `V(Q, x<sub>i</sub><sup>1</sup>x<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>...x<sub>i</sub><sup>j</sup>)` (implemented using the LLM) checks the correctness of the overlapping states. Only verified states (`S<sub>v</sub>`) are retained.\n",

The authors provide a mechanism to expand the KG with new lemmas derived from solved problems.\n",

    "**3. Intermediate Result Selection:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm prioritizes deeper states within reasoning chains.  When multiple overlapping groups of intermediate results exist, the selection process, formalized in Algorithm 1, utilizes a pairwise comparison based on the depth of states within chains (Equation 1).  If group A can be inferred from group B, B is selected; otherwise, the union of A and B is considered. Algorithm 1 iteratively applies pairwise comparisons to select the optimal group. If no overlap occurs, the final state from each chain is verified.\n",

    "* **TriMaster100:** SSC-CoT significantly outperforms baselines, achieving a score 34% higher than CoT-SC (the second-best method).  Even without the KG, SSC-CoT's performance is 29% higher than CoT-SC.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **MATH Level 5:** SSC-CoT surpasses the second-best method by 7.2% in accuracy.  Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of both the KG and the intermediate result selection mechanism.  Qualitative analysis showcases SSC-CoT's ability to identify critical intermediate steps more efficiently than ToT, often leading to correct solutions. However, the paper also highlights cases where SSC-CoT makes errors, primarily due to limitations in the LLM's arithmetic capabilities and the verification process.\n",

    "This paper investigates the self-consistency of large language models (LLMs) when dealing with entity ambiguity.  The authors argue that while LLMs demonstrate impressive performance due to their vast factual knowledge, inconsistencies in their responses, particularly under ambiguity, raise concerns about their trustworthiness.  The core focus is on how LLMs handle ambiguous entities (entities with multiple meanings, e.g., \"Apple\" as a fruit or company).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The study employs a four-part experimental protocol designed to disentangle an LLM's \"knowing\" (awareness of multiple entity readings) from its \"applying knowledge\" (correctly selecting the appropriate reading based on the context).  The methodology uses 49 ambiguous entities, each with at least two interpretations: a specific entity type (animal, fruit, myth, person, location, abstract concept) and a company name (Table 1).  The research questions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **RQ1:** How well do LLMs resolve entity ambiguity?\n",
    "2. **RQ2:** Is the ability to infer the correct entity type biased towards \"preferred readings\"?\n",
    "3. **RQ3:** Can LLMs self-verify their answers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Four studies comprise the evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Study 1 (K): Knowledge Verification:**  Assesses whether the LLMs possess knowledge of both interpretations of each ambiguous entity. Prompts like `\"Tell me about <entity type> <entity>\"` are used.  A secondary study (1a) directly asks about ambiguity awareness using prompts like `\"Can <entity> mean anything other than <entity type>? Answer only with Yes or No.\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Study 2 (K + A): Eliciting Preferences:** Determines each LLM's preferred reading for each entity type by giving an underspecified grouping task: `\"Group the following entities according to what they all have in common: <entities>\"`. The model's choice reveals its preferred interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Study 3 (K → A): Knowledge to Application:** Evaluates the ability to apply knowledge.  LLMs are prompted with questions requiring the correct entity reading, e.g., `\"Provide the <entity property> for <entity>\"` (ambiguous) and compared to a non-ambiguous baseline with explicit entity type hints, e.g., `\"Provide the <entity property> for <entity type> <entity>\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Study 4 (A → K): Applying to Knowing:** Tests self-consistency.  Factual information extracted from Study 3 responses is used to create verification prompts, e.g., `\"Does an animal X have <info> speed?\"`.  The focus is on consistency within the model's own responses, not factual accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results and Discussion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **RQ1:**  While Study 1 confirmed that LLMs \"know\" about multiple readings, Study 3 showed that they struggle to apply this knowledge correctly when given ambiguous prompts, achieving only 85.3% accuracy on average.  Non-ambiguous prompts (with entity type hints) yielded 90.5% accuracy, indicating a significant ambiguity-related performance drop.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **RQ2:**  A strong bias towards preferred readings was observed (Table 2).  Accuracy was 85.4% for preferred readings and only 74.5% for alternative readings in ambiguous prompts. This bias correlates with entity popularity on Wikipedia, suggesting that frequent exposure to a specific meaning in the training data influences the LLM's preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **RQ3:**  LLMs demonstrated poor self-verification capabilities (Figure 3).  Even when given the same information shortly after providing it, models frequently failed to confirm the information's correctness.  Further probing with explanatory prompts revealed that models sometimes contradict themselves in the first answer but offer correct information in the subsequent explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall, the paper's findings highlight a critical gap in current LLMs:**  They may possess factual knowledge, but they struggle with consistent and reliable application of that knowledge under ambiguous situations, exhibiting bias towards preferred readings and a lack of self-consistency.  The authors conclude that addressing entity ambiguity is crucial for building more trustworthy LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The study uses a simplified definition of ambiguity (company vs. non-company).  Further research into the varying degrees of polysemy and potential ambiguity in entity properties is suggested.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code and Data:**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The Appendices provide further detail on entity popularity analysis, annotation procedures, prompt variations, and additional experimental results, including tables showing detailed accuracy breakdown and examples of LLM responses across all studies.

    "## Toolformer: An Extensive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper introduces Toolformer, a language model (LM) that learns to utilize external tools via simple Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) in a self-supervised manner.  The core idea addresses the paradox where large LMs excel at few-shot learning but struggle with tasks requiring external knowledge or computation (like arithmetic) that smaller models readily handle.  Toolformer aims to combine the strengths of both, enabling a large LM to access and leverage external resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Literature Review:** The paper reviews existing large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and their impressive zero- and few-shot capabilities. However, it highlights limitations such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inability to access up-to-date information.\n",
    "* Hallucination of facts.\n",
    "* Difficulty with low-resource languages.\n",
    "* Lack of mathematical skills.\n",
    "* Unawareness of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing methods to overcome these limitations either require extensive human annotation or restrict tool use to specific tasks. Toolformer aims to address these shortcomings by learning tool usage in a self-supervised way, maintaining generality, and deciding when and how to use tools autonomously.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Approach & Methodology:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Toolformer's methodology leverages the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs to generate and filter API calls. The process involves these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**a. API Call Representation:** Each API call is represented as a tuple  `c = (a_c, i_c)`, where `a_c` is the API name and `i_c` is the input. The linearized sequences are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `e(c) = <API> a_c (i_c) </API>` (call without result)\n",
    "* `e(c, r) = <API> a_c (i_c) → r </API>` (call with result)\n",
    "\n",
    "`<API>`, `</API>`, and `→` are special tokens (in practice, \"[\", \"]\", and \"→\").\n",
    "\n",
    "**b. Dataset Augmentation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sampling API Calls:** For each text `x`, a prompt `P(x)` encourages the LM to suggest API calls.  Candidate positions `i` for API calls are sampled based on the probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "   `p_i = p_M(<API> | P(x), x_{1:i-1})`\n",
    "\n",
    "   where `p_M` is the LM's probability assignment.  Positions with `p_i > τ_s` (sampling threshold) are kept. For each position, API calls are sampled from the LM.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Executing API Calls:** The generated API calls are executed, retrieving text-based results `r`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Filtering API Calls:**  A weighted cross-entropy loss `L_i(z)` is calculated for the following tokens, comparing:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `L_i⁺ = L_i(e(c_i, r_i))` (loss with API call and result)\n",
    "   * `L_i⁻ = min(L_i(ε), L_i(e(c_i, ε)))` (loss without API call or with call but no result)\n",
    "\n",
    "   API calls where `L_i⁻ - L_i⁺ ≥ τ_f` (filtering threshold) are kept – meaning the API call reduces the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Finetuning:** The original dataset `C` is augmented with filtered API calls to create `C*`. The LM `M` is then fine-tuned on `C*` using a standard language modeling objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "**c. Inference:** During inference, decoding proceeds until the `→` token appears. The corresponding API is called, the result is inserted, and decoding continues.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Tools:** Toolformer integrates five tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Question Answering:**  Uses Atlas, a retrieval-augmented LM.\n",
    "* **Wikipedia Search:** A BM25 retriever on a Wikipedia dump.\n",
    "* **Calculator:** A simple Python script for basic arithmetic.\n",
    "* **Machine Translation:** The NLLB 600M parameter model.\n",
    "* **Calendar:** Returns the current date.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Experiments and Results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Toolformer (based on GPT-J 6.7B) was evaluated on various downstream tasks in a zero-shot setting:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **LAMA (Logical Entailment):** Toolformer significantly outperformed GPT-J, GPT-3, and OPT (66B), primarily using the Question Answering API.\n",
    "* **Math Datasets (ASDiv, SVAMP, MAWPS):** Toolformer, even with API calls disabled, performed better than baselines. Enabling API calls dramatically improved performance, surpassing GPT-3 and OPT, mainly using the calculator.\n",
    "* **Question Answering (WebQS, NQ, TriviaQA):** Toolformer outperformed GPT-J baselines, heavily relying on the Wikipedia search API, but lagged behind GPT-3, highlighting limitations in interaction with the search engine.\n",
    "* **Multilingual Question Answering (MLQA):**  Toolformer improved with API calls, using the translation API, but did not consistently outperform GPT-J due to dataset distribution shift issues.\n",
    "* **Temporal Datasets (TempLAMA, Dateset):** Toolformer achieved best results, relying on Wikipedia and QA for TempLAMA, and the calendar API for Dateset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Language Modeling Evaluation:**  Toolformer's perplexity on WikiText and CCNet remained comparable to GPT-J after fine-tuning, indicating that adding API calls didn't negatively impact core language modeling abilities (when API calls were disabled at inference).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scaling Laws:**  The ability to effectively utilize tools emerged in models with around 775M parameters or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Decoding Strategy:** Modifying the decoding to consider top-k tokens (instead of just the most likely) increased API call usage and improved performance on some tasks.\n",
    "* **Data Quality:** Analysis of generated API calls showed that high filtering scores often corresponded to useful calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Limitations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Toolformer's current design cannot handle chained or interactive tool use.\n",
    "* Sensitivity to input wording in deciding API call usage.\n",
    "* Sample inefficiency, especially for tools like the calculator.\n",
    "* Does not consider computational cost of API calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Toolformer demonstrates the potential for LLMs to self-learn tool use via APIs.  Its self-supervised approach leads to substantial zero-shot performance improvements, sometimes even exceeding larger models on specific tasks.  However, limitations in chained/interactive use, sample efficiency, and computational cost awareness remain areas for future research.  The code and specific details of the dataset generation and model training are provided in the appendices.  Several tables summarize the experimental results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This summary provides a comprehensive overview of the paper, including all the key algorithms, formulas, notations, concepts, results, methodology, and discussion points.  The key mathematical notation focuses on the calculation of weighted cross-entropy loss for the purpose of filtering helpful API calls.  The use of special tokens for API calls and results is explicitly mentioned. The limitations of the approach are also thoroughly discussed.  Note that due to the length of the paper, all tables and figures are referenced but not fully reproduced here.\n"

    "This paper introduces ToRA, a series of Tool-integrated Reasoning Agents designed to enhance Large Language Models' (LLMs) mathematical problem-solving capabilities.  ToRA overcomes LLMs' limitations in complex mathematical reasoning by seamlessly integrating natural language reasoning with external tools (computation libraries and symbolic solvers). The core methodology involves three key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Curating Interactive Tool-Use Trajectories:**  The authors leverage GPT-4 to generate high-quality datasets (ToRA-Corpus) containing tool-use trajectories for mathematical problems from GSM8k and MATH datasets.  These trajectories consist of interleaved sequences of natural language rationales (\\(r_i\\)), program code for tool use (\\(a_i\\)), and tool execution outputs (\\(o_i\\)). A trajectory τ is represented as:  \\(τ = r_1a_1o_1...r_{n-1}a_{n-1}o_{n-1}r_n\\), where \\(r_n\\) contains the final answer. The generation process, formalized in Algorithm 1, uses GPT-4 to iteratively generate rationales, programs, and execute programs until a stopping condition (answer in a \"\\boxed{}\") is met.  Equations 1, 2, and 3 describe the probabilistic generation of rationales and programs conditioned on previous steps.\n",

The interleaved format consistently outperformed rationale-only and program-only approaches. Output space shaping significantly improved performance, especially for smaller models and more challenging problems.\n",

    "This paper introduces a novel approach to solving grade-school level math word problems using large language models (LLMs).  Instead of directly training the LLM to generate solutions (finetuning), the authors propose a \"verification\" method: training a separate model to evaluate the correctness of generated solutions. At test time, multiple solutions are generated, and the verifier selects the highest-ranked one.  The key idea is that verification is a simpler task than generation, leading to better scaling properties.  The paper also introduces a new dataset, GSM8K, designed to facilitate research in this area.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. GSM8K Dataset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Description:** A curated dataset of 8,500 grade-school math word problems and their natural language solutions (7,500 training, 1,000 test). Problems involve 2-8 steps and basic arithmetic (+, -, ×, ÷). Solutions are in natural language, not just equations.\n",
    "* **Design Principles:**\n",
    "    * **High Quality:** Human-created problems with rigorous quality control (estimated <2% errors).\n",
    "    * **High Diversity:**  Problems avoid linguistic templates to make held-out test performance a more meaningful metric.\n",
    "    * **Moderate Difficulty:** Challenging for state-of-the-art LLMs but solvable with elementary concepts.\n",
    "    * **Natural Language Solutions:**  Solutions are natural language explanations, allowing analysis of the model's reasoning process.\n",
    "* **Availability:**  [https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math](https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math)\n",

    "**2. Related Work:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper reviews existing math word problem datasets, highlighting their limitations (small size, low quality, templatized problems, lack of natural language solutions).  It contrasts GSM8K with these datasets, emphasizing its larger size, higher quality, diversity, and use of natural language solutions.  The paper also discusses related methods, including various seq2seq models, specialized architectures, and pretraining techniques.  The authors note that their verification approach is similar to concurrent work by Shen et al. (2021), but differs in focusing on natural language solutions and demonstrating better data scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Two main methods are compared:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Finetuning:**  A standard approach where the LLM is directly trained to generate solutions using a cross-entropy loss on all training tokens.  The final answer is evaluated for correctness.\n",
    "* **Verification:** A two-stage process:\n",
    "    1. **Generator:** An LLM (same architecture as the verifier, often the same model size) is finetuned for 2 epochs to generate multiple (e.g., 100) high-temperature solutions for each problem.\n",
    "    2. **Verifier:** A separate LLM is trained to classify solutions as correct or incorrect based solely on whether the final answer is correct.  It's trained on the generated solutions from the generator.  A joint objective is used, combining the classification loss with a standard language modeling loss.  The verifier outputs a probability of correctness for each solution.\n",
    "    3. **Test Time:** At test time, the verifier ranks the generated solutions, and the top-ranked solution is selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.  Mathematical Formulas and Notation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cross-entropy loss:** Used in finetuning to measure the difference between the model's predicted probability distribution and the true distribution of tokens.\n",
    "* **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Used as part of the verifier's loss function to measure the difference between the verifier's predicted probability of correctness and the true label (correct/incorrect).\n",
    "* **Temperature (T):** A hyperparameter controlling the randomness of the LLM's output during sampling. Higher temperature leads to more diverse but potentially less accurate solutions.  \\(T=0\\) means argmax sampling (most likely token).\n",
    "* **Test@N:** The percentage of problems solved correctly at least once when allowing the model N guesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Results and Outcomes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Finetuning:**  Performance improves with larger model size and more training data, but scaling is poor.  Extrapolation suggests enormous model sizes would be needed to achieve high accuracy. Overfitting is observed with increased training epochs.\n",
    "* **Verification:** Significantly outperforms finetuning, especially with larger datasets.  The 6B parameter verifier slightly outperforms the 175B parameter finetuned model on the full GSM8K dataset, suggesting a 30x model size improvement.\n",
    "* **Ablations:**\n",
    "    * **Token-level vs. Solution-level Verifiers:** Token-level verifiers (evaluating correctness after each token) are less prone to overfitting and ultimately perform better than solution-level verifiers.\n",
    "    * **Joint Objective:** Including the language modeling objective in the verifier's training improves performance.\n",
    "    * **Generator/Verifier Model Size:** Using a large generator with a smaller verifier is more effective.\n",
    "    * **Dropout:**  Significantly improves both finetuning and verification, acting as a strong regularizer.  Residual dropout (20%) is used.\n",
    "* **Test Time Compute:** Increasing the number of generated solutions (up to a point) improves performance. Majority voting among top-ranked solutions also improves accuracy.\n",

These are too numerous and complex to reproduce here but demonstrate the key findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Overall Methodology:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper employs a rigorous empirical approach. It introduces a new dataset, compares two different methods (finetuning and verification), performs ablation studies to understand the contribution of different components, and analyzes the scaling properties of the methods.  The results are presented clearly with figures and tables.  The authors acknowledge limitations (e.g., imperfections in the calculator annotation system) and suggest directions for future work.\n"

    "## Universal Self-Consistency for Large Language Model Generation: An Extensive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper introduces Universal Self-Consistency (USC), a method designed to improve the quality of Large Language Model (LLM) generated outputs, particularly for open-ended tasks where traditional self-consistency techniques fall short.  The core idea is to leverage the LLM itself as a consistency evaluator, selecting the most consistent answer from multiple candidate responses generated by the same model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Literature Review and Problem Statement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper reviews existing methods for improving LLM outputs, including neural reranking and LLM-based scoring of responses.  It highlights the success of self-consistency with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for tasks with structured answers (e.g., single numerical answers to mathematical problems).  However,  standard self-consistency relies on an answer extraction process to aggregate results (typically via majority vote based on exact match), limiting its applicability to free-form text generation tasks (e.g., summarization, open-ended question answering).  The authors argue that assessing consistency is inherently simpler than directly evaluating answer quality, addressing a weakness of existing LLM-based evaluation methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Methodology: Universal Self-Consistency (USC)**\n",
    "\n",
    "USC addresses the limitations of standard self-consistency by using the LLM to perform the consistency assessment directly. The methodology is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multiple Response Generation:** The LLM generates multiple responses (`k` responses, typically 8 in the experiments) to the same prompt using a chosen decoding scheme (e.g., temperature > 0).\n",
    "2. **Consistency Prompt:**  All generated responses are concatenated into a single prompt, which includes instructions directing the LLM to select the *most consistent* response from the candidates.  (See Figures 6 and 7 for examples).\n",
    "3. **Response Selection:** The LLM then outputs the index (or identifier) of the selected response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Mathematical Formulation and Notation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper does not introduce any novel mathematical formulas.  The underlying logic is based on the concept of consistency, but it's not formally defined mathematically. The selection process is implicitly defined by the LLM's behavior in response to the consistency prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Algorithms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The core algorithm of USC is straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def universal_self_consistency(prompt, model, k=8, temperature=0.6):\n",
    "  \"\"\"\n",
    "  Performs Universal Self-Consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Args:\n",
    "    prompt: The input prompt.\n",
    "    model: The LLM.\n",
    "    k: The number of responses to generate.\n",
    "    temperature: The temperature parameter for sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Returns:\n",
    "    The index of the selected response.\n",
    "  \"\"\"\n",
    "  responses = [model.generate(prompt, temperature=temperature) for _ in range(k)]\n",
    "  combined_prompt = f\"Evaluate these responses:\\n{chr(10).join(responses)}\\nSelect the most consistent response based on majority consensus.\\nStart your answer with 'The most consistent response is Response X' (without quotes).\"\n",
    "  selection = model.generate(combined_prompt) #Assumed to return \"The most consistent response is Response X\"\n",
    "  response_index = int(selection.split(\"Response \")[1][0])\n",
    "  return response_index\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Experiments and Results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors evaluate USC on four categories of tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Mathematical Reasoning:** GSM8K and MATH datasets.  USC achieves comparable performance to standard self-consistency (SC), even without explicit answer extraction. (Table 1)\n",
    "* **Code Generation:** BIRD-SQL (text-to-SQL) and ARCADE (Python code generation) datasets. USC matches the performance of execution-based self-consistency (which requires running the generated code), without needing code execution. (Table 2)\n",
    "* **Long-Context Summarization:** GovReport and SummScreen datasets.  USC significantly outperforms baseline methods (greedy decoding, random selection) on ROUGE and BERTScore metrics. (Table 3)\n",
    "* **Open-Ended Question Answering:** TruthfulQA dataset. USC shows improved truthfulness and informativeness compared to baselines, evaluated using GPT-3 judges. (Table 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tables:**  The paper presents several tables summarizing the experimental results (Tables 1-4, 10, 11). These tables compare USC against greedy decoding, random sampling, standard self-consistency (where applicable), and execution-based self-consistency (where applicable).  Appendix A includes additional tables (Tables 7-9) comparing performance to an oracle (the best possible selection from the candidates).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Ablation Studies:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Response Ordering:**  USC is robust to the order of responses in the combined prompt. (Table 5)\n",
    "* **Number of Responses (k):** Increasing `k` generally improves performance, but there are diminishing returns and potential downsides related to context length limitations. (Figure 3)\n",
    "* **Selection Criteria:**  Modifying the prompt to select the \"most detailed\" response instead of the \"most consistent\" one can yield further performance gains in summarization tasks. (Table 6)\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. USC vs. Standard Self-Consistency:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors analyze the alignment between USC and SC's selections on tasks where both are applicable. They find that a significant portion of discrepancies are due to \"tied votes,\" where multiple responses have the same maximum vote count.  The match rate between USC and SC's choices is often higher than their individual accuracies, suggesting that the consistency criterion is easier to evaluate than correctness. (Figure 4, 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Conclusion and Limitations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "USC successfully extends self-consistency to free-form generation tasks and matches the performance of standard self-consistency on tasks where it is applicable. However, limitations include context length restrictions on the number of responses and the lack of a built-in confidence measure.  Future work includes addressing these limitations, mitigating position bias, and improving long-context understanding in LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall, the paper presents a novel and practical approach to improving LLM outputs.  USC's simplicity and broad applicability make it a valuable contribution to the field, while the identified limitations suggest avenues for future research.**\n"
